Given her vital signs of pulse 110/min, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 90/65 mm Hg, along with the presence of a 5-cm deep stab wound at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line, which anatomical structure in her chest is most likely to be injured?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Okay, let's figure out what's going on here. A woman comes in with a stab wound from a screwdriver. It's in her chest, upper border of the 8th rib, left side, kind of around the midaxillary line. First thought, that's pretty close to where the lung sits, right?\\n\\nLet's talk about location first. This spot is along the left side of her body. Above the 8th rib, like that, is where a lot of important stuff lives, like the bottom part of the left lung, possibly the diaphragm too, especially considering how deep the screwdriver went.\\n\\nThe wound is 5 cm deep. That sounds pretty deep. I mean, it could definitely reach down to the lung tissue or maybe the diaphragm. Given that it's midaxillary, we're in the territory where the lower lobe of the left lung hangs out. It's also possible there's some intersection with where the diaphragm begins, but the lung feels more probable somehow.\\n\\nNow, her vitals are concerning: elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. This is serious. My gut says that this kind of vital sign picture could mean something like pneumothorax or maybe hemothorax. Both can happen if the lung gets punctured, and they can make the blood pressure drop and the heart rate skyrocket since she's obviously distressed.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the most obvious culprit is the lower lobe of the left lung. The wound's depth and her condition point that way. And, yeah, this adds up with pneumothorax or maybe blood collecting in the chest—the kind of stuff that can really mess with breathing and circulation.\\n\\nAlright, with this in mind, it sure seems like the lung is the most likely thing that got hurt here. Makes sense given the situation, where the wound is, considering her symptoms, and the whole setup.\",\n 'Response': 'In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured is the lower lobe of the left lung. The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung.

We've got sudden weakness in the person's left arm and leg - and that screams something neuro-related, maybe a stroke?\\n\\nBut wait, there's more. The right lower leg is swollen and tender, which is like waving a big flag for deep vein thrombosis, especially after a long flight or sitting around a lot.\\n\\nSo, now I'm thinking, how could a clot in the leg end up causing issues like weakness or stroke symptoms?\\n\\nOh, right! There's this thing called a paradoxical embolism. It can happen if there's some kind of short circuit in the heart - like a hole that shouldn't be there.\\n\\nLet's put this together: if a blood clot from the leg somehow travels to the left side of the heart, it could shoot off to the brain and cause that sudden weakness by blocking blood flow there.\\n\\nHmm, but how would the clot get from the right side of the heart to the left without going through the lungs and getting filtered out?\\n\\nHere's where our cardiac anomaly comes in: a patent foramen ovale or PFO. That's like a sneaky little shortcut in the heart between the right and left atria.\\n\\nAnd it's actually pretty common, found in about a quarter of adults, which definitely makes it the top suspect here.\\n\\nSo with all these pieces - long travel, leg clot, sudden weakness - a PFO fits the bill perfectly, letting a clot cross over and cause all this.\\n\\nEverything fits together pretty neatly, so I'd bet PFO is the heart issue waiting to be discovered. Yeah, that really clicks into place!\\n</think>\\nThe specific cardiac abnormality most likely to be found in this scenario is a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This condition could allow a blood clot from the venous system, such as one from a deep vein thrombosis in the leg, to bypass the lungs and pass directly into the arterial circulation. This can occur when the clot moves from the right atrium to the left atrium through the PFO. Once in the arterial system, the clot can travel to the brain, potentially causing an embolic stroke, which would explain the sudden weakness in the left arm and leg. The connection between the recent travel, which increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis, and the neurological symptoms suggests the presence of a PFO facilitating a paradoxical embolism.</s>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning to the model \nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=16,  # LoRA rank: Determines the size of the trainable adapters (higher = more parameters, lower = more efficiency)\n    target_modules=[  # List of transformer layers where LoRA adapters will be applied\n        \"q_proj\",   # Query projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"k_proj\",   # Key projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"v_proj\",   # Value projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"o_proj\",   # Output projection from the attention layer\n        \"gate_proj\",  # Used in feed-forward layers (MLP)\n        \"up_proj\",    # Part of the transformer’s feed-forward network (FFN)\n        \"down_proj\",  # Another part of the transformer’s FFN\n    ],\n    lora_alpha=16,  # Scaling factor for LoRA updates (higher values allow more influence from LoRA layers)\n    lora_dropout=0,  # Dropout rate for LoRA layers (0 means no dropout, full retention of information)\n    bias=\"none\",  # Specifies whether LoRA layers should learn bias terms (setting to \"none\" saves memory)\n    use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\",  # Saves memory by recomputing activations instead of storing them (recommended for long-context fine-tuning)\n    random_state=3407,  # Sets a seed for reproducibility, ensuring the same fine-tuning behavior across runs\n    use_rslora=False,  # Whether to use Rank-Stabilized LoRA (disabled here, meaning fixed-rank LoRA is used)\n    loftq_config=None,  # Low-bit Fine-Tuning Quantization (LoFTQ) is disabled in this configuration\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-08T16:05:34.972860Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-08T16:05:34.973200Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-08T16:05:41.966962Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-08T16:05:34.973172Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-08T16:05:41.965956Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.4.8 patched 36 layers with 36 QKV layers, 36 O layers and 36 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize the fine-tuning trainer — Imported using from trl import SFTTrainer\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model_lora,  # The model to be fine-tuned\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,  # Tokenizer to process text inputs\n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune,  # Dataset used for training\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",  # Specifies which field in the dataset contains training text\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,  # Defines the maximum sequence length for inputs\n    dataset_num_proc=2,  # Uses 2 CPU threads to speed up data preprocessing\n\n    # Define training arguments\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,  # Number of examples processed per device (GPU) at a time\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,  # Accumulate gradients over 4 steps before updating weights\n        num_train_epochs=3, # Full fine-tuning run\n        warmup_steps=5,  # Gradually increases learning rate for the first 5 steps\n        max_steps=70,  # Limits training to 60 steps (useful for debugging; increase for full fine-tuning)\n        learning_rate=2e-4,  # Learning rate for weight updates (tuned for LoRA fine-tuning)\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use FP16 (if BF16 is not supported) to speed up training\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use BF16 if supported (better numerical stability on newer GPUs)\n        logging_steps=10,  # Logs training progress every 10 steps\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",  # Uses memory-efficient AdamW optimizer in 8-bit mode\n        weight_decay=0.01,  # Regularization to prevent overfitting\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",  # Uses a linear learning rate schedule\n        seed=3407,  # Sets a fixed seed for reproducibility\n        output_dir=\"outputs\",  # Directory where fine-tuned model checkpoints will be saved\n    ),\n)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-08T16:05:43.621860Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-08T16:05:43.622190Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-08T16:05:46.715272Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-08T16:05:43.622162Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-08T16:05:46.714505Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Unsloth: Tokenizing [\"text\"] (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ?

We've got a 33-year-old woman who was stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver. That's pretty serious. She's been in the emergency department for 15 minutes, and her vital signs are showing she's in trouble. Her pulse is 110 beats per minute, her breathing is 22 breaths per minute, and her blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. That's not good. She's probably losing blood, and her blood pressure is dropping. \n\nNow, let's look at the wound. It's a 5-cm deep stab wound at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line. That's right in the middle of the chest. It's not in the front or the back, but more towards the side. \n\nWhen you think about the chest, the heart is in the middle, and the lungs are on either side. The 8th rib is pretty high up, so it's not near the diaphragm or the stomach. It's more towards the lungs. \n\nNow, if you stab someone in the chest, especially with something like a screwdriver, you're likely to hit the lungs. The lungs are big and take up a lot of space in the chest. They're also pretty vulnerable because they're not protected by bones or much muscle. \n\nSo, if I had to guess, I'd say the stab wound is most likely to have injured the lungs. They're right there in the middle of the chest, and they're not protected by much. \n\nLet's see, what else could it be? The heart is also in the middle, but it's more protected by the ribs and the sternum. It's not as exposed as the lungs. Plus, the wound is pretty high up, so it's not likely to have hit the heart. \n\nThe diaphragm is lower down, and the stomach is even lower. So, they're not in the right spot for this wound. \n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure the lungs are the most likely to be injured here. They're right in the middle, and they're not protected by much. That makes sense. \n\nSo, based on everything, I'd say the lungs are the most likely structure to be injured in this case. They're right there in the middle of the chest, and they're not protected by much. That's what I think. </think>\nIn this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured by the stab wound is the lungs. The wound is located at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line, which is a region where the lungs are prominent. The lungs are not protected by bones or significant muscle, making them vulnerable to such injuries. Given the vital signs and the location of the wound, it is reasonable to conclude that the lungs are the most likely structure to be affected.</s>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"final_answer = \"\"\"In this scenario, the most likely anatomical structure to be injured by the stab wound is the lungs.

The location of the stab wound—at the upper border of the 8th rib in the left midaxillary line—indicates proximity to the lower lobe of the lung. The depth of the wound (5 cm) suggests it is sufficient to reach lung tissue. Her vital signs of elevated heart rate and low blood pressure could signal complications like a pneumothorax or hemothorax, common consequences of lung trauma that would result from a penetrating injury in this area.
