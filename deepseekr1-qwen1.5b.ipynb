Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the patient is 61 and has a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities but no leakage at night. That's interesting because usually, if someone has a leaky bladder, they might experience both during and at night. But here, it's only at night. So that suggests there's something unusual about her bladder function at night.\n\nShe's undergoing a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. Gynecological exams are usually to check for irregularities, like irregular menstrual bleeding, which could indicate something else, but in this case, it's more about the bladder. The Q-tip test is used to measure the volume of urine in the bladder. So the Q-tip test result will tell us how much urine is in the bladder at this time.\n\nNow, the question is about what the cystometry test would reveal. Cystometry is a procedure where a catheter is inserted into the bladder to measure the volume of fluid inside. There are two main tests: the direct cystomy (DC) and the indirect cystomy (IC). DC is used when the bladder is mostly empty, which is typical for women with a leaky bladder. IC is used when the bladder has some fluid, which might be the case here.\n\nThe question is asking about the residual volume and detrusor contractions. Residual volume is the amount of urine that remains in the bladder after a urination. Detrusor contractions are contractions that occur in the detrusor muscles of the bladder, which help empty the bladder. If there are contractions, it might indicate that the bladder is still empty or that it's not empty as expected.\n\nGiven that she has no leakage at night, but involuntary urine loss during activities, it's possible that her bladder is mostly empty at night. However, during activities, it might still be slightly filled, leading to a leak. So during activities, she might have some residual urine, but at night, it's mostly gone.\n\nWhen the Q-tip test is done, it measures the urine in the bladder. If the result is positive, it means there's some urine in the bladder. In this case, since she has no leakage at night, the Q-tip test might show a positive result because she's experiencing a leak during activities, which is unusual.\n\nNow, if she's done with a cystometry test, the result would indicate whether the bladder is mostly empty or not. If the cystomy shows a negative result, it means the bladder is mostly empty, which would align with her having no leakage at night. If it's positive, it means the bladder has some fluid, but since she has a leak during activities, that might suggest a leak despite the Q-tip test showing positive.\n\nWait, but the question is about the cystometry revealing residual volume and detrusor contractions. So if the cystomy is negative, it suggests the bladder is mostly empty, so residual volume is low. If it's positive, it suggests some fluid, but the leak suggests that despite having some fluid, it's leaking. So the cystomy might not be able to see the leak because it's not in the bladder, only in the ureter.\n\nSo in this case, if the cystomy is negative, it means residual volume is low, and there's no leakage in the bladder. But the leak happens during activities, which is outside the cystomy scope. So the cystomy would not show any contractions because contractions happen in the bladder.\n\nWait, but the question is about what the cystometry would reveal. So if the cystomy is negative, residual volume is low. If it's positive, some fluid. But in this case, the Q-tip test is positive, meaning some urine in the bladder. If the cystomy is negative, that suggests that the bladder is mostly empty, so no contractions. If the cystomy is positive, it means some fluid, but the leak is during activities, so it's not part of the cystomy.\n\nSo, putting it together, if the cystomy is negative, residual volume is low, and there are no contractions. If it's positive, residual volume is higher, but since she has a leak, it's not clear what the contractions would indicate.\n\nBut the question is asking what the cystometry would most likely reveal. So if the cystomy is negative, that's the most likely outcome, indicating low residual volume and no contractions. If it's positive, it would indicate some fluid, but not necessarily contractions because contractions are in the bladder.\n\nWait, but the leak happens during activities, which is outside the cystomy. So the cystomy wouldn't detect that. Therefore, the cystomy would show either low residual volume or some fluid, but not contractions.\n\nSo, the most likely outcome is that the cystomy would show low residual volume and no contractions, indicating that the bladder is mostly empty and there's no leakage in the bladder, which aligns with her having no leakage at night and some leakage during activities.\n\nWait, but the Q-tip test is positive, meaning some urine in the bladder. If the cystomy is negative, that means residual volume is low. If it's positive, some fluid, but the leak is during activities, so it's not in the cystomy.\n\nSo the answer would be that the cystometry would most likely show low residual volume and no detrusor contractions.\n</think>\n\nThe cystometry test would most likely reveal low residual volume and no detrusor contractions. This is because the patient has no leakage at night, indicating a mostly empty bladder, which aligns with a negative cystomy result.

Given this clinical presentation and history, what is the most likely diagnosis?',\n 'Complex_CoT': \"Alright, let’s break this down. We have a 45-year-old man here, who suddenly starts showing some pretty specific symptoms: dysarthria, shuffling gait, and those intention tremors. This suggests something's going wrong with motor control, probably involving the cerebellum or its connections.\\n\\nNow, what's intriguing is that he's had a history of alcohol use, but he's been off it for the past 10 years. Alcohol can do a number on the cerebellum, leading to degeneration, and apparently, the effects can hang around or even appear long after one stops drinking.\\n\\nAt first glance, these symptoms look like they could be some kind of chronic degeneration, maybe something like alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, but hold on. This looks different. The symptoms just came on all of a sudden. Chronic degenerations typically have a more gradual onset.\\n\\nOkay, let’s reconsider this sudden nature. It’s making me think of something more acute, more rapid onset. Hmm, if we dig back into his history of drinking, there might have been some damage done, leading to nutritional deficiencies, like a lack of thiamine.\\n\\nWernicke’s encephalopathy is a classic possibility here. That condition pops up due to thiamine deficiency, often after a history of alcohol use. It’s known for causing ataxia, confusion, and eye movement issues. However, he’s not showing the full triad of symptoms; there's no mention of confusion or eye problems, so maybe it doesn’t fit perfectly.\\n\\nOh, wait a second, maybe we're missing something simpler. Given the acute nature of the symptoms, maybe this is more in line with something like a stroke. Sudden onset can definitely suggest a vascular event. With his alcohol history, he’s at risk for things like high blood pressure, which can increase stroke risk.\\n\\nIn particular, lacunar strokes can mess with motor coordination, speech, the works. These are small, but significant enough to cause these exact symptoms: dysarthria, tremors, and a shuffling gait.\\n\\nBut hang on, what if there’s another angle we’re missing? Chronic alcohol effects might still play a role here, just in a different way. There’s a condition called acquired hepatocerebral degeneration. This can happen in people with a history of liver disease due to alcohol, even years after they’ve quit. It can result in symptoms like these because of how substances get deposited in the brain.\\n\\nLinking this back to our patient, his history with alcohol could’ve led to some liver issues, and now, here we are with these symptoms showing up suddenly. Makes sense, right? So, considering everything, acquired hepatocerebral degeneration seems to fit quite nicely. That’s probably our most fitting diagnosis for this situation.\",\n 'Response': \"Considering the clinical presentation of sudden onset dysarthria, shuffling gait, and intention tremors in a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol use who has been abstinent for the past 10 years, the most likely diagnosis is acquired hepatocerebral degeneration.\\n\\nThis condition is associated with chronic liver disease, which can often be a consequence of long-term alcohol use. Despite the patient's abstinence from alcohol for a decade, previous alcohol use may have led to underlying liver dysfunction. This dysfunction, even if subclinical, can cause encephalopathy due to the accumulation of neurotoxic substances that affect the brain. The sudden onset of these neurological symptoms aligns with how acquired hepatocerebral degeneration can manifest, making it a probable diagnosis in this scenario.\"}"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# We need to format the dataset to fit our prompt training style \nEOS_TOKEN = tokenizer.eos_token  # Define EOS_TOKEN which the model when to stop generating text during training\nEOS_TOKEN","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T17:36:13.857251Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T17:36:13.857590Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T17:36:13.863918Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T17:36:13.857562Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T17:36:13.863169Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":15,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define formatting prompt function\ndef formatting_prompts_func(examples):  # Takes a batch of dataset examples as input\n    inputs = examples[\"Question\"]       # Extracts the medical question from the dataset\n    cots = examples[\"Complex_CoT\"]      # Extracts the chain-of-thought reasoning (logical step-by-step explanation)\n    outputs = examples[\"Response\"]      # Extracts the final model-generated response (answer)\n    \n    texts = []  # Initializes an empty list to store the formatted prompts\n    \n    # Iterate over the dataset, formatting each question, reasoning step, and response\n    for input, cot, output in zip(inputs, cots, outputs):  \n        text = train_prompt_style.format(input, cot, output) + EOS_TOKEN  # Insert values into prompt template & append EOS token\n        texts.append(text)  # Add the formatted text to the list\n\n    return {\n        \"text\": texts,  # Return the newly formatted dataset with a \"text\" column containing structured prompts\n    }","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T17:36:15.092014Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T17:36:15.092288Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T17:36:15.097942Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T17:36:15.092268Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T17:36:15.097245Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Update dataset formatting\ndataset_finetune = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched = True)\ndataset_finetune[\"text\"][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T17:36:16.276161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T17:36:16.276442Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T17:36:16.322851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T17:36:16.276423Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T17:36:16.322228Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map:   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"aba88618f4754e90a60620341e0844f8"}},"metadata":{}},{"execution_count":17,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"\"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. \\nWrite a response that appropriately completes the request. \\nBefore answering, think carefully about the question and create a step-by-step chain of thoughts to ensure a logical and accurate response.\\n\\n### Instruction:\\nYou are a medical expert with advanced knowledge in clinical reasoning, diagnostics, and treatment planning. \\nPlease answer the following medical question. \\n\\n### Question:\\nA 61-year-old woman with a long history of involuntary urine loss during activities like coughing or sneezing but no leakage at night undergoes a gynecological exam and Q-tip test. Based on these findings, what would cystometry most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions?\\n\\n### Response:\\n<think>\\nOkay, let's think about this step by step. There's a 61-year-old woman here who's been dealing with involuntary urine leakages whenever she's doing something that ups her abdominal pressure like coughing or sneezing. This sounds a lot like stress urinary incontinence to me. Now, it's interesting that she doesn't have any issues at night; she isn't experiencing leakage while sleeping. This likely means her bladder's ability to hold urine is fine when she isn't under physical stress. Hmm, that's a clue that we're dealing with something related to pressure rather than a bladder muscle problem. \\n\\nThe fact that she underwent a Q-tip test is intriguing too. This test is usually done to assess urethral mobility. In stress incontinence, a Q-tip might move significantly, showing urethral hypermobility. This kind of movement often means there's a weakness in the support structures that should help keep the urethra closed during increases in abdominal pressure. So, that's aligning well with stress incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's think about what would happen during cystometry. Since stress incontinence isn't usually about sudden bladder contractions, I wouldn't expect to see involuntary detrusor contractions during this test. Her bladder isn't spasming or anything; it's more about the support structure failing under stress. Plus, she likely empties her bladder completely because stress incontinence doesn't typically involve incomplete emptying. So, her residual volume should be pretty normal. \\n\\nAll in all, it seems like if they do a cystometry on her, it will likely show a normal residual volume and no involuntary contractions. Yup, I think that makes sense given her symptoms and the typical presentations of stress urinary incontinence.\\n</think>\\nCystometry in this case of stress urinary incontinence would most likely reveal a normal post-void residual volume, as stress incontinence typically does not involve issues with bladder emptying. Additionally, since stress urinary incontinence is primarily related to physical exertion and not an overactive bladder, you would not expect to see any involuntary detrusor contractions during the test.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning to the model \nmodel_lora = FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model(\n    model,\n    r=16,  # LoRA rank: Determines the size of the trainable adapters (higher = more parameters, lower = more efficiency)\n    target_modules=[  # List of transformer layers where LoRA adapters will be applied\n        \"q_proj\",   # Query projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"k_proj\",   # Key projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"v_proj\",   # Value projection in the self-attention mechanism\n        \"o_proj\",   # Output projection from the attention layer\n        \"gate_proj\",  # Used in feed-forward layers (MLP)\n        \"up_proj\",    # Part of the transformer’s feed-forward network (FFN)\n        \"down_proj\",  # Another part of the transformer’s FFN\n    ],\n    lora_alpha=16,  # Scaling factor for LoRA updates (higher values allow more influence from LoRA layers)\n    lora_dropout=0,  # Dropout rate for LoRA layers (0 means no dropout, full retention of information)\n    bias=\"none\",  # Specifies whether LoRA layers should learn bias terms (setting to \"none\" saves memory)\n    use_gradient_checkpointing=\"unsloth\",  # Saves memory by recomputing activations instead of storing them (recommended for long-context fine-tuning)\n    random_state=3407,  # Sets a seed for reproducibility, ensuring the same fine-tuning behavior across runs\n    use_rslora=False,  # Whether to use Rank-Stabilized LoRA (disabled here, meaning fixed-rank LoRA is used)\n    loftq_config=None,  # Low-bit Fine-Tuning Quantization (LoFTQ) is disabled in this configuration\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T17:36:20.576334Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T17:36:20.576618Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T17:36:26.506106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T17:36:20.576597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T17:36:26.505188Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Unsloth 2025.1.8 patched 28 layers with 28 QKV layers, 28 O layers and 28 MLP layers.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Initialize the fine-tuning trainer — Imported using from trl import SFTTrainer\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    model=model_lora,  # The model to be fine-tuned\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,  # Tokenizer to process text inputs\n    train_dataset=dataset_finetune,  # Dataset used for training\n    dataset_text_field=\"text\",  # Specifies which field in the dataset contains training text\n    max_seq_length=max_seq_length,  # Defines the maximum sequence length for inputs\n    dataset_num_proc=2,  # Uses 2 CPU threads to speed up data preprocessing\n\n    # Define training arguments\n    args=TrainingArguments(\n        per_device_train_batch_size=2,  # Number of examples processed per device (GPU) at a time\n        gradient_accumulation_steps=4,  # Accumulate gradients over 4 steps before updating weights\n        num_train_epochs=3, # Full fine-tuning run\n        warmup_steps=5,  # Gradually increases learning rate for the first 5 steps\n        max_steps=70,  # Limits training to 60 steps (useful for debugging; increase for full fine-tuning)\n        learning_rate=2e-4,  # Learning rate for weight updates (tuned for LoRA fine-tuning)\n        fp16=not is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use FP16 (if BF16 is not supported) to speed up training\n        bf16=is_bfloat16_supported(),  # Use BF16 if supported (better numerical stability on newer GPUs)\n        logging_steps=10,  # Logs training progress every 10 steps\n        optim=\"adamw_8bit\",  # Uses memory-efficient AdamW optimizer in 8-bit mode\n        weight_decay=0.01,  # Regularization to prevent overfitting\n        lr_scheduler_type=\"linear\",  # Uses a linear learning rate schedule\n        seed=3407,  # Sets a fixed seed for reproducibility\n        output_dir=\"outputs\",  # Directory where fine-tuned model checkpoints will be saved\n    ),\n)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-04T17:36:28.950838Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-04T17:36:28.951173Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-04T17:36:31.177247Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-04T17:36:28.951147Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-04T17:36:31.176325Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Map (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/500 [00:00<?, ?
